# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Java. The purpose of this project is to provide a practice ground for JUnit testing and Gherkin syntax for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a hands-on exercise for learning and practicing JUnit testing. The project is structured to encourage writing test cases for different game scenarios.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
- `src/test/java`: Designed for JUnit test classes to ensure the correctness of the game logic.
- `features`: Utilizes Gherkin syntax for writing BDD-style scenarios and step definitions.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- JUnit (for testing)
- Cucumber (for Gherkin-based testing)

## Running Tests

-Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.
